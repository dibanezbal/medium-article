      <h1>The Miracle of Citricus and Tropical Fruit</h1>
      <p>From limes to lemons. From oranges to papayas. I love citricus and tropical fruit.
      That's why I decided to leave you my very best opinion about any of them in
      such a lame article</p>

    <h2>Papaya</h2>
    <p>It's squize in your mouth without even thinking about it. The properties
    of the balblablabla are amaizing: beginning with blablabla one, blablabla two.
    Just think about having a piece of one of them now in your mouth.</p>
    <h2>Lemon</h2>
    <p>As a citricus lover, I can't avoid mention the lemon and it's varieties.
    Just imagine Trump licking a lemon, how does his face look like? If you feel bored
    during the lockdown, try to make a nice lemonade and squize a bit your day.</p>

    <h2>Ginger</h2>
    <p>Did you know that it's one of the stomach-ache killers? Well, now you know it!
    Yes, I know Ginger it's not a tropical fruit at all but it roots just pump on my mind
    while I was typing and I though, why not tell you how lovely ginger root and ginger beers are.
    Oh! And they're also good against hangover! Take it into account next time!</p>
